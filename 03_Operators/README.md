## Arithmetic operators

Create three variables `a`, `b`, `c` with values of `2`, `5`, `4` respectively.

Create variables that will store the results of the following operations:
- the variable `result1`, in which the result of the sum of `a` and `b` will be stored,
- the variable `result2` in which the remainder of dividing `a` by `b` will be stored,
- the variable `result3` in which the result of dividing `b` by `c` will be stored.

Display the results of these operations.

Using the variables with calculation results, assign to the variable `result4` and display:

- the result of the sum of `a` and `b` divided by the **remainder of dividing** `a` by `b`.


## Dividing by 0

Display the result of dividing `3` by `0`.


## Variable comparison

### Exercise 1

In the file you have variables `a` and `b`.

Display the result of the comparison of these variables' values **with their type taken into account**.


### Exercise 2

In the file you have variables `a` and `b`.

Display the result of the comparison of these variables' values **without comparing their type**.


## Incrementation

In the file you have the variables `a` and `b`.

Assign the value of 10 to the variable **a**, then increment `a` by one and assign it to the variable `b`.
