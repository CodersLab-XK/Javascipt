## Creating an array - for
### Use the for loop for this exercise

Write a program that, based on the value of variable `n`, creates a one-dimensional array in a variable named `array` with consecutive integers from `1` to `n`.


#### Hint
To insert values into an array, use the `push` method, e.g.: `array.push(2);`.


## Even and odd numbers - for
### Use the for loop for this exercise

Write a program that writes all numbers from `zero` to `n` (including n) based on the value of the n variable.

For each number, the program has to display whether the number is even or odd. For example:
```
0 – even
1 – odd
2 – even
3 – odd
...
```


#### Hint

How to check if the number is even or odd?  
Just divide it modulo 2. If the result is 0, then the number is even, otherwise it is odd. Use the "if" instruction.


## Creating an array - while
### Use the while loop for this exercise

Write a program that uses the value of variable `n` to create a one-dimensional array in the variable `array` with consecutive integers from 1 to `n`.


## Even and odd numbers - while
### Use the while loop for this job

Write a program that writes all numbers from `zero` to `n` (inclusive) based on the value of variable n.

For each number the program should display whether the number is even or odd. For example:
```
0 – even
1 – odd
2 – even
3 – odd
...
```


#### Hint

How to check if the number is even or odd?  
Just divide it modulo 2. If the result is 0, then the number is even, otherwise it is odd. Use the "if" instruction.


## Displaying strings - while
### Use the while loop for this exercise

Write a program that displays the words "I love JS" n times based on the value of the variable `n`.

Note the number of times the string is displayed if `n = 0`.


## Displaying array data

Write a program that will print out the values from the prepared two-dimensional array in subsequent lines.


## Creating a 2D array

Write a program that will create a multidimensional array in the variable `array` according to the values in variables `rows` and `cols`.

The elements of the array should be **subsequent integers starting from one**.


## Multiplication table

Write a program that creates a multiplication table for the given variable `n`.

Return the results in a two-dimensional array (in variable `calc`).
The values in this array should be the calculations in the form of text.

For example, for n = 3 we will get the following result:
```
1 x 1 = 1 | 1 x 2 = 2 | 1 x 3 = 3
2 x 1 = 2 | 2 x 2 = 4 | 2 x 3 = 6
3 x 1 = 3 | 3 x 2 = 6 | 3 x 3 = 9
```

Only the calculation texts are stored in the array, e.g:
```
1 x 1 = 1
```

The array should be displayed in the **console**. Only then add the vertical lines.


## Stars

Write a program that will draw the following diagram (here shown for `n = 5`) based on the value of variable `n`.

Use nested (dependent) loops for this.

```
*
**
***
****
*****
```


## Break

Write a program that uses the `break` instruction to stop the loop when `i` equals `5`.
